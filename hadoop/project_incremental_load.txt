use case:
----------

load the incremental data into hive data warehouse, by retaining only the latest records. 

company: employee , wages , date= sep01
company: employee , wages , date= sep02


1. load your daily data file into hive table [raw table] - this should contain only current day data. 

2. load the data into employee_master table with history [all days data should be available here] eg: sep01 , sep02..... sep24

3. always maintain latest records in the master table. 
    a) if emp1 from day1 = 1000 
          emp1 from day2 = 1500   
        then update the record of emp1 in master tabel to salary=1500 
        result on day1
        emp1 1000
        
        result on day2
        emp1 1500 

    b) if there is not change for emp1 
        retain the same record. 

4. automate the solution using shell script -> scheulde to run on daily basis based on date parameter. 

    sh <job>.sh <sep01>

    sh <job>.sh <sep02>
